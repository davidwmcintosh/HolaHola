description: 6 sharp edges in esbuild bundling, Node ESM imports, and Drizzle's sql tag that look like unrelated bugs (server restart loops, "Unexpected reserved word", silently-failed queries, TOCTOU races, truncated regex matches) but each has a narrow, specific fix.

## esbuild isMain guard — bundle collapse

## The rule

Never use `import.meta.url.endsWith(process.argv[1])` (or `===`) as a "am I the main script?" guard in any file that is or could be imported by the server bundle.

**Why:** esbuild merges all source files into one `dist/index.js`. Inside that bundle, every module's `import.meta.url` is `file:///…/dist/index.js` — the same value as `process.argv[1]`. The check is always `true`, so any top-level `if (isMain) { … process.exit() … }` block fires at server boot as an async IIFE, then kills the process when it finishes (exit 0 on success, exit 1 on failure).

**How it manifested:** `populate-principle-embeddings.ts` was killing the production server ~1–2 min after every boot. Logs showed "command finished successfully with exit code 0" (Neon WS query succeeded → `process.exit(0)`) or "exit status 1" (Neon WS dropped mid-query → catch → `process.exit(1)`). The server appeared to start and serve briefly, then die in a restart loop.

## Correct pattern

Check the **exact actual filename** in `process.argv[1]`, not `import.meta.url`:

```ts
import { basename } from 'node:path';

// Safe — works with tsx source paths and cannot be triggered by importing
// my-script-name.test.ts.
const isMain = basename(process.argv[1] ?? '') === 'my-script-name.ts';
```

- `npx tsx server/scripts/my-script-name.ts` → basename is the filename ✓
- `node dist/index.js` → `argv[1]` is `dist/index.js` ✗ → `isMain` false ✓

`reembed-memory.ts` already uses the safe suffix pattern
(`argv[1]?.endsWith('reembed-memory.ts')`).

Avoid `.includes('my-script-name')` for scripts imported by tests: a file named
`my-script-name.test.ts` would incorrectly execute the CLI IIFE during import.

## How to apply

Any script in `server/scripts/` that (a) exports a function AND (b) is dynamically
imported by `server/index.ts`, `server/routes.ts`, or a test must use an exact
basename or a narrow `.endsWith('<script>.ts')` check, NOT `import.meta.url`.
Scripts that are CLI-only (never imported by the server) are still affected by
the bundle collapse if esbuild touches them, so prefer the argv form everywhere.

## Shared helper now exists

Both failure modes above (bundle collapse and test-file substring collision)
are now consolidated into one guard: `server/scripts/lib/cli-entrypoint.ts`
exports `isDirectCliInvocation(scriptBasename)`, an exact
`basename(process.argv[1]) === scriptBasename` check. It is safe both for a
script reached by the esbuild bundle (the bundle's argv[1] basename is never
the script's own filename) and for a script whose own test file imports it
(a `test-<subject>.test.ts` file is never an *exact* basename match, even
though it contains the script's name as a substring). New CLI scripts under
`server/scripts/` should import this helper rather than re-deriving either
check ad hoc — a project-wide audit (Sept 2026) found 20 scripts using the
unsafe `process.argv[1]?.includes(...)` form and migrated all of them, plus
the original `coordination-runtime-status.ts` reference implementation, to
this helper.

## Node.js ESM await import() inside a callback

## The rule

When using `node --input-type=module` (inline ESM scripts), **always import at the top of the file**. Never `await import()` inside a Promise constructor, callback, or any non-async scope.

## What fails

```javascript
// BROKEN — "Unexpected reserved word" in Node 20
const req = https.request ? https.request(options) : (await import('http')).request(options);

// ALSO BROKEN — await import inside Promise constructor callback
const result = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const req = (await import('https')).request(options, (res) => { ... });
});
```

## What works

```javascript
// CORRECT — static import at the top
import https from 'https';
import http from 'http';
import fs from 'fs';

// ... then use https / http anywhere below, including inside callbacks
const req = https.request(options, (res) => { ... });
```

**Why:** In Node 20 ESM, `await` is only valid at the top level of the module — not inside a callback passed to a `new Promise()` constructor, even though the outer script is async. The parser sees `await` in a synchronous callback scope and rejects it.

**How to apply:** Any time you write an inline Node.js script for API calls (Gemini, Alden, internal endpoints), put all imports at the top as static `import` statements. The `node --input-type=module << 'EOF'` heredoc pattern supports top-level await natively — use it, but keep imports static.

## Drizzle sql tag — dynamic import required in route handlers

The top-level `import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm'` at the module head produces a SQL template tag object that is NOT compatible with `getSharedDb().execute()` in route handlers. The call silently fails with a "Failed query" error (params are empty; the query text is shown but never runs).

**Why:** The drizzle `sql` tagged template literal creates a `SQL` object. The Neon pooled connection's `.execute()` expects the SQL object to come from the same import chain that was used to configure the DB pool. When imported statically at the top of a large file like `routes.ts`, the binding breaks in this specific combination.

**How to apply:** Inside any route handler that needs raw SQL via `getSharedDb()`, use:

```ts
const { sql: rawSql } = await import('drizzle-orm');
const obsDb = getSharedDb();
const rows = await obsDb.execute(rawSql`SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE id = ${someId}`);
```

The dynamic import resolves to the same module — no performance concern. The pattern already appears in many handlers throughout `routes.ts`; match it rather than inventing a new approach. The row accessor pattern also varies by driver: try `(result as any).rows?.[0] ?? (result as any)[0] ?? null`.

**Why this matters:** The top-level `sql` import looks identical and TypeScript doesn't catch the mismatch. The error ("Failed query: ... params: ") looks like a DB connectivity problem but is actually an import binding issue.

## Drizzle sql tag cannot bind a raw array for ::text[]

postgres.js's own tagged-template client (`` db`INSERT ... VALUES (${jsArray}::text[])` ``) serializes a JS array directly into a Postgres array literal. Drizzle-orm's `sql` tag used with `db.execute(sql\`...\`)` (via `getSharedDb()`/`getUserDb()` — both Drizzle instances, per `server/db.ts`) does not do this: a raw JS array bound this way does not cast to `text[]` correctly.

**How to apply:** Build the array as a Postgres array-literal STRING and interpolate that string with the `::text[]` cast, instead of interpolating the array itself:

```ts
function pgTextArrayLiteral(values: string[]): string {
  return `{${values.map(v => `"${v.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}"`).join(',')}}`;
}
// ...
await db.execute(sql`INSERT INTO t (col) VALUES (${pgTextArrayLiteral(['a', 'b'])}::text[])`);
```

This pattern already existed in `agent-session-autosave.ts` (`participantsArray`) before being reused in `save-transcript-now.ts`'s chat-capture participants fix (Sep 2026). Scripts using the raw postgres.js tag directly (e.g. `capture-watchdog.ts`'s `` db`...` ``) don't need this — they can bind a JS array to `::text[]` natively.

## SQL CASE expression — Drizzle parameter vs column disambiguation

## The rule
In a Drizzle `sql\`...\`` template, `${content}` is a **bound parameter** and bare `content` is the **SQL column reference**. They are not ambiguous — the SQL engine distinguishes them correctly. The atomic CASE WHEN pattern is safe and preferred over a JS read-then-write sequence.

## Correct atomic pattern
```sql
UPDATE conversation_memories
SET content = CASE
      WHEN LENGTH(${content}) >= LENGTH(content)
      THEN ${content}
      ELSE content
    END,
    summary = ${summary}
WHERE id = ${memoryId}
```
`LENGTH(${content})` → length of the incoming JS string (bound parameter).
`LENGTH(content)` → length of the existing DB column value.
Both evaluate correctly in a single round-trip with no concurrency window.

**Why:** A read-then-write alternative (SELECT length, then conditional UPDATE) introduces a TOCTOU race: two concurrent writers can both read the old length and then both write, allowing a shorter stale write to overwrite a longer committed one. The atomic CASE expression eliminates this window.

**How to apply:** When writing a monotonic-guard UPDATE (e.g. "only overwrite if new value is larger/newer"), use a SQL CASE expression inside the UPDATE rather than a SELECT + conditional UPDATE. Drizzle's interpolation disambiguates parameters from column names correctly.

## Lazy regex + multiline $ silently truncates a match

A regex meant to lazily consume "everything up to a following marker or the
end of the document" typically looks like:

```js
new RegExp(`PREFIX[\\s\\S]*?(?=\\nNEXT_MARKER|$)`)
```

Adding the `m` (multiline) flag to that pattern breaks it silently. With `m`,
`$` matches before *every* line's terminator, not just at the true end of the
input. Because the quantifier is lazy, the engine stops at the *first*
position satisfying the lookahead -- which is now the end of the first line
of the block, not the end of the document. The match (and anything built on
it, like a `.replace()`) then only ever covers the first line of the intended
span, silently leaving the rest of that block's old content sitting in the
output instead of being replaced.

**Why:** in JavaScript, `$` without `m` already matches only the true end of
the input (unlike some other regex flavors that match before a trailing
newline), so `m` was never needed to make `$` reachable there at all -- it
only adds extra, unwanted reachability at every line break, which defeats the
"don't stop until you truly must" point of the lazy quantifier. A fixture
where the block being matched is a single line, or is the last thing in the
document, will not expose this -- the bug only shows up when the intended
match spans multiple lines *and* something else follows it.

**How to apply:** whenever pairing a lazy `[\s\S]*?` (or `.*?`) with
`(?=OTHER_MARKER|$)` to consume up to a marker-or-end, do not add the `m`
flag unless `^`/`$` are also doing real per-line anchoring work elsewhere in
the same pattern. Test with a fixture where the target block has multiple
lines of body content *and* a further section follows it -- that is the
minimal case that distinguishes "matched the whole block" from "matched only
its first line."
