# Named Record behavioral lock

## The rule
Any utterance containing a Named Record phrase (`'episode'`, `'pull up'`, `'our first'`, `'the transcript'`, `'read our'`, `'look back at'`, `'what were your exact'`) suspends the latency-aversion default and requires a tool call before responding.

**Why:** Line 357 of system-prompt.ts ("your default move is to invite rather than search") had a specific "why" (latency) that overrode the general honesty rules. Gemini treats a directive with a performance rationale as stronger than a general ethical directive. "Pull up episode 1" matched neither of the two hardcoded SHARED_HISTORY_TRIGGER_PHRASES, so the model confabulated. The Archive Guardian's "nothing found" injection ended with "Trust your intuition" — read as permission to invent.

**How to apply:**
- `memory-chain-guard.ts` — NAMED_RECORD_PHRASES (7 phrases) + SHARED_HISTORY_TRIGGER_PHRASES now includes all 9
- `system-prompt.ts` — line 357 now scopes "invite rather than search" to *vague* references only; Named Record section added using existing Awareness/Experience tier language (no new tier names)
- `gemini-live-session.ts` — `preTurnIsNamedRecord` flag set during pre-turn scan; "nothing found" injection is conditional: Named Record → CRITICAL directive ("do not guess, call the tool now"); all other turns keep gentle form

Gemini approved unconditionally in Round 2. Typecheck clean. Aug 6 2026.
