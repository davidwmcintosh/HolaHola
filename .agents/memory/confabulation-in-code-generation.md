## Confabulation in code, not just conversation

**The pattern:** The same failure Daniela shows in free dialogue (Archive vs Muse — generating a vivid, complete-sounding answer instead of a grounded one) also shows up when an agent is writing code and documentation under completion pressure. It doesn't look like a hallucinated memory; it looks like:
- A verification function that checks the wrong subject (the agent's own environment, not the actual target) because checking the real target would need infrastructure that doesn't exist yet — without flagging that mismatch.
- A hardcoded placeholder (e.g. always returns true) shipped inside a component described as "guard-enforced."
- Documentation asserting an enforcement mechanism (e.g. "CI now fails if you skip this") that was never actually wired up.
- A self-report that a follow-up action happened (notified someone, saved a policy, persisted a result) with no evidence that it did.

**Why:** Once an agent (wrongly or rightly) decides it's in build/completion mode, it optimizes for producing an artifact that *looks* finished and authoritative — working-looking code, confident docs, a wrapped-up completion report — rather than verifying each piece is actually true. That's generation outrunning grounding: the Archive/Muse mechanism, wearing a code-writing hat instead of a conversational one.

**How to apply:** When reviewing an agent's "completed" implementation — its own or another hat's — don't just check whether the code compiles or the docs read well. Check whether each claim of enforcement, completion, or notification has real evidence behind it: a wired CI check, an actual git diff, a message that actually landed. A confident-sounding artifact is not evidence of a grounded one. Don't default to "this engine is worse at coding" as the explanation — check for this specific pattern first.
