## Disposable database test boundary

name: Disposable database test boundary
description: Safety rule for regression tests whose production paths write database records.
---

Any regression test that can write database state must fail closed unless the process has positively verified a disposable, job-local database. Local and Replit runs without that proof may keep static and in-memory coverage, but must not reach the persistence path. Full persistence coverage belongs in CI with an isolated database.

**Why:** Best-effort cleanup did not protect shared Neon. Interrupted or failed tests left synthetic coordination projections and hundreds of identical scratchpad memories behind. A cleanup hook is recovery logic, not an isolation boundary. A green gate can also hide a broken required-variable contract when an alternate database selector happens to supply the target, while swallowed teardown errors can conceal forbidden mutation attempts against immutable evidence.

**How to apply:** Before adding or extending a DB-writing test, use the project's verified CI database contract. Guard the whole mutating setup/test/teardown path, preserve full coverage in isolated CI, and add a check that detects removal of the guard. Independently prove each suite fails when database coverage is required but its exact verified target variables are absent. On disposable branches, retain immutable records until branch destruction rather than issuing best-effort deletes.

**Gate-only test pitfall (own var vs. ambient var):** several `scripts/neon-branch.ts`-gated `*-postgres.test.ts` files write their existence check as `const url = process.env.NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` instead of their own dedicated `<PREFIX>_TEST_DATABASE_URL`. Since `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` is the app's own database and is already set in a normal dev shell, that ambient-first check makes the file throw a confusing "`<PREFIX>_TEST_DATABASE_DISPOSABLE=1` is required" error the moment anyone runs it directly outside the gate, instead of skipping cleanly. Confirmed live (Sep 2026) in `test-coordination-task-artifact-registry-postgres.test.ts`, `test-coordinator-v2-host-reauthorization-postgres.test.ts`, `test-coordination-v2-runtime-bootstrap-postgres.test.ts`, and `test-coordinator-v2-schema-postgres.test.ts`; already fixed in `test-founder-task-ownership-postgres.test.ts` and correctly avoided in `test-coordination-session-service.test.ts` (own var first) and `test-coordination-windows-generation.test.ts` (returns `undefined` immediately whenever `<PREFIX>_REQUIRE_DATABASE_TESTS` isn't `'1'`, regardless of the ambient var). Gate on the file's own var first, or add that early return, so "run outside the gate" reliably means "skip", not "throw."

## Fixed-ID collision under concurrent CI batches

**Fixed-ID collision under concurrent CI batches:** `test-founder-mode-absence-guard.ts` seeds/reads/cleans up a nudge row keyed by a *fixed, deterministic* test-user id (not randomized per run) against the shared dev database. Running two `npm run test:ci:guards` invocations concurrently (e.g. while isolating an unrelated flake, spot-checking a fix in one process while a full gate runs in another) made both instances race on that same row — one process's cleanup/read raced the other's write, producing "row not found" / null-return failures with no code regression involved. A clean solo run passed every time. Confirmed Sep 22 2026 while verifying Task 1519's fix; distinct from that task's root cause (in-place file mutation) — this is a shared-row collision from a non-unique fixture id, same underlying lesson (shared-state tests need per-run isolation) via a different mechanism. Treat any CI self-check with a hardcoded fixture id as unsafe to run in parallel with itself against the shared DB.

## Disposable-gate own-var-first

---
name: Disposable-DB test gates must check their own var first
description: Why a disposableTarget()-style gate must read its own dedicated *_TEST_DATABASE_URL before the ambient NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL, and the two safe shapes for the check.
---

Many `*.test.ts` files in this repo use a `disposableTarget()`-style helper so a
Postgres-writing test only runs against a Neon branch that `scripts/neon-branch.ts`'s
migration gate provisioned and marked disposable, never against the app's own
database. `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` is the ambient var holding the app's own
database connection — it is truthy in essentially every normal dev shell, well
outside any gate.

**The bug shape:** `disposableTarget()` reads `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` first and
branches on its presence/absence (`if (!url) { ...maybe throw...; return undefined }`).
Because that var is *always* set in a normal dev shell, the function always falls
through past the "am I even inside a gate" check and into the disposable/forbidden
verification branch — which then throws a confusing `"..._DISPOSABLE=1 is required"`
or similar error instead of skipping cleanly, any time someone runs the file
directly (`npx tsx --test <file>`) outside the gate.

**The fix — two safe shapes, both seen in this repo:**
1. **Own-var-first:** read the file's own dedicated gate var (e.g.
   `COORDINATOR_V2_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `FOUNDER_TASK_OWNERSHIP_TEST_DATABASE_URL`)
   as the primary `url`/presence check, and throw-if-required only in that branch.
   Cross-check `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL === url` as a *secondary* condition further
   down, not as the entry gate.
2. **Early-return:** immediately `return undefined` (no throw) whenever the file's
   `*_REQUIRE_DATABASE_TESTS` flag isn't `'1'`/`"1"`, before any other check runs —
   safe even if `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` is read first, because presence of that
   ambient var alone can never trigger the throwing branch.

**Why:** this exact bug was found and fixed independently at least seven times
across this repo's Coordinator V2 / founder-task-ownership / release-cutover-
attestation test families — it is the default mistake, not an edge case, whenever
someone writes a new disposable-DB gate by copying an existing `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL`-first
example instead of an own-var-first or early-return one.

**How to apply:** when adding or reviewing any `disposableTarget()`-style gate,
grep the function for which var is checked in the first `if`. If it's the ambient
`NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL`/`CI_DATABASE_URL`-style var and the branch can throw,
run the file directly with that var set (simulating a normal dev/CI shell) and
every gate-specific var unset — a clean skip is required, a thrown error is the bug.
Also add a self-check test in the same file that reads its own source
(`readFileSync(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), ...)`) and asserts the fail-closed
`_REQUIRE_DATABASE_TESTS === '1'` branch and `_FORBIDDEN_SHARED_URL` check are both
still present, so a future edit can't silently regress the guard.
