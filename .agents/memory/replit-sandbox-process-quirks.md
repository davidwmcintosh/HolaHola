## Backgrounding a process: always use the tool's own run_in_background

Never append a manual trailing `&` to a command string passed to the shell-exec tool's own
`run_in_background: true` option, and never rely on a manual `nohup ...  &`/`disown` alone
(without `run_in_background: true`) to survive past the end of the current call. Both mistakes
have independently reproduced multiple times:

**Combining `&` with `run_in_background: true`:** `run_in_background: true` already runs the
given command as the tracked background task and returns a task id immediately — that IS the
backgrounding mechanism. Adding your own `&` on top makes the *tracked* process just a launcher:
it forks the real command into a second, untracked detached process and then exits right away
(falling through to any trailing `echo`/etc.), so the tool immediately reports the tracked task
as "exited with code 0" while the real work is still starting up. The child can then be silently
orphaned/reaped along with the launcher's process group — confirmed by re-running the identical
command without the manual `&` and seeing it behave correctly (log file populated, `ps aux` shows
it alive) where the double-backgrounded version left no process and no log output at all.

**Manual `nohup ... &` instead of `run_in_background: true`:** a plain shell-exec call (no
`run_in_background: true`) that itself runs `nohup some-long-command > log 2>&1 &` and then
returns does NOT leave that command running — the log file is never created and no process
survives past the call. Confirmed directly: `bash server/scripts/run-validation-suite.sh >
/tmp/out.log 2>&1 &` issued inside a plain (non-backgrounded) call produced no log file and no
live process once the call returned; re-issuing the identical plain command (no `nohup`, no
trailing `&`) through the tool's own `run_in_background: true` parameter worked correctly instead.
The same teardown hits `pg_ctl -D <datadir> ... start` (which daemonizes/detaches the postmaster
itself) run inside a normal foreground call — it reports "server started" successfully but is
gone by the next call, with a clean "database system was shut down" in its own log. The sandbox
appears to tear down the whole process group when a foreground shell call completes, regardless
of what the child itself did to try to detach.

**The tell when this has happened:** `ps aux` shows no matching process at all (not even a
zombie) after a call that *appeared* to background something has returned — no error, no crash
log, just silence and zero further log growth.

**How to apply:** when a command needs to run in the background, pass the plain command (no
`nohup`, no trailing `&`) with `run_in_background: true` and read its state via `Monitor`/the
background-task-end notification/its log file. Never combine the tool's backgrounding with
shell-level `&`, and never substitute shell-level `nohup`/`&`/`disown` for it.


## Standing up a disposable local Postgres

Postgres 16.x binaries are already available via the nix store (find them with e.g.
`find /nix/store -maxdepth 1 -iname '*postgresql-16.1*'` then use `<store-path>/bin/`). This
makes it possible to fully replicate GitHub Actions' `test-unit`/`test-guards`
local-Postgres-service setup (`postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/<db>`, `CI=true`)
for manual verification instead of waiting on a real CI run.

**Recipe:** launch Postgres itself (not `pg_ctl` — see the backgrounding topic above for why)
as a genuine backgrounded task: ShellExec with `run_in_background: true` running
`postgres -D <datadir> -p <port> -k /tmp -h 127.0.0.1` directly. Then use a separate foreground
call (or `Monitor` on the background task's log for "ready to accept connections") to `createdb`,
run `drizzle-kit migrate` (point `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` at the instance), and run the target
test file with `CI=true CI_DATABASE_URL=... NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL=...` (all three must satisfy
`server/ci-database.ts`'s `getVerifiedCiDatabaseUrl` gate: loopback host, and
`NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` exactly equal to `CI_DATABASE_URL`). Tear down with `ShellKill` on the
background task (or a clean `pg_ctl ... stop` first) and remove the scratch data directory.

**Omitting `CI=true` fails silently, not loudly:** setting `CI_DATABASE_URL` and
`NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL` to a local disposable instance without also setting `CI=true` does not
fail loudly. `server/db.ts`'s `getDb()` only routes through the plain `pg` driver when
`server/ci-database.ts`'s `getVerifiedCiDatabaseUrl()` returns a value, which requires
`CI==='true'` **and** `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL===CI_DATABASE_URL` together — both conditions, not
just a matching URL. Omit `CI=true` and it silently falls through to the
`@neondatabase/serverless` driver, which speaks a different wire protocol than plain Postgres and
produces an unrelated-looking, mismatched error shape instead of a clean connection failure —
looking exactly like a cascade of application-level test failures. Always set all three
(`CI`, `CI_DATABASE_URL`, `NEON_SHARED_DATABASE_URL`) together.

**Check for an existing local-DB test harness before hand-rolling one:** before manually
following the recipe above, check `package.json` for a `test:*-local`-style script (e.g.
`test:coordination-ledger`, backed by `scripts/run-coordination-ledger-local.mjs`) — several test
families already have a one-shot script that stands up a disposable local Postgres, applies
migrations, seeds fixtures, runs the full relevant test suite (including any CI self-checks), and
tears everything down automatically. These scripts spawn Postgres directly as a real child
process (not `pg_ctl`/`nohup` in a foreground shell), so launch them with your own shell tool's
true background-task support rather than a trailing `&`. Prefer an existing script like this over
the manual recipe whenever one matches the area under test; fall back to the manual recipe only
where no such harness exists. If a Neon-branch-gate (or similar) job dies mid-run from the
backgrounding mistake above, check `neon-branch.ts list` for an orphaned `test/migration-*`
branch and delete it before retrying — the gate's own cleanup step never got to run.


## ss is unavailable -- use lsof for port checks

`ss` is not installed in this Replit container's shell (`bash: ss: command not found`). If you
check a listening port with `ss -ltnp 2>/dev/null`, the `2>/dev/null` swallows the "command not
found" error and you see empty output indistinguishable from "nothing is listening" — a healthy,
actively-serving process can look crashed.

Use `lsof -i :<port>` instead (confirmed available); it reports `LISTEN` and any `ESTABLISHED`
connections directly. If you do try `ss` or `netstat`, run it with `2>&1` (not `2>/dev/null`) at
least once so a missing binary surfaces as visible text instead of silent empty output.

This surfaced while verifying a workflow restart after a schema migration: two differently-named
`Start_application_*.log` files (both starting with the same one-time boot preamble) briefly
looked like a crash-and-retry, and an `ss` check with stderr suppressed then looked like
confirmation. `lsof -i :5000` plus `ps aux` plus a `curl` 200 showed the single real process was
healthy the whole time — the WorkflowsRestart tool's own success return already meant the
platform had confirmed serving; the extra log archaeology was true but non-essential given that
guarantee.


## A workflow's 'finished' status can arrive with the log tail truncated

Observed running the "Validation suite" workflow (`run-validation-suite.sh`, ~110+ chained
checks, run-to-completion script rather than a persistent server). Polling with RefreshAllLogs
showed steady progress with zero failures, then a later poll reported the workflow status as
"finished" with "no new content" to drain — but the most recent drained snapshot file's tail
stopped mid-check: a check header had printed, its result line never appeared, and the script's
own trailing summary ("ALL VALIDATION SUITE CHECKS PASSED", always printed on exit 0) was missing
entirely. Reading that exact file directly from disk (bypassing RefreshAllLogs' incremental
"since last cursor" semantics) showed the same truncated tail, and no further snapshot file
appeared even several minutes later.

**Why:** the workflow status tracker (which reports "finished"/exit code) and the
log-drain-to-file mechanism are not perfectly synchronized for process-style (run-to-completion)
workflows. The last buffered stdout chunk written at/after process exit can be dropped from the
snapshot files even though the process supervisor correctly recorded completion. `ps aux`
confirmed no process for the script or any of its sub-checks was still running, which ruled out a
genuine hang and pointed at a log-capture artifact instead.

**How to apply:** if a script-workflow's drained log tail ends abruptly mid-check while its
status already reads "finished" (not "running"), do not assume a hang or silent failure, and do
not immediately re-run the entire (possibly many-minutes-long) suite from scratch to find out
what happened. First confirm via `ps aux` (and `lsof -i :<port>` for any port the check might
bind) that nothing from the suite is still executing. If genuinely stopped, read the runner
script to identify exactly which check(s) after the last captured line remain unconfirmed, and
directly re-invoke just those specific check commands via ShellExec to get their real pass/fail
result. That is far cheaper than a full re-run and, combined with the zero-failures evidence
already captured up to the truncation point, is just as conclusive.
