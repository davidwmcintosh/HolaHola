# (Replit's own git integration, `git maintenance`, etc.) — hangs forever on
# an interactive "authenticity of host ... can't be established" prompt
# instead of failing fast. That has repeatedly wedged this repo's
# .git/index.lock for 20-100+ minutes, starving out any other git operation
# against this repo, including platform task-agent merges. See
# .agents/memory/ssh-git-hang-pitfalls.md. Pre-trusting the key here — pinned
# and verified, not blindly accepted — closes that hang at its source on
# every startup. Keep the pinned key in sync with scripts/github-release-ssh.sh.
