# ── Gemini approval gate ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Run FIRST — before any mutating steps — so a failed check halts immediately
# without running npm install or a migration.
#
# Gate logic lives in scripts/gemini-gate-check.sh so it can be exercised by
# CI tests without triggering the npm install / migration steps below.
#
# Protected-file list is parsed at runtime from docs/GEMINI_REQUIRED.md —
# the single authoritative source.  To add a new protected file, update that
# doc; this script requires no separate change.
# To pass this gate the committing agent must include a docs/gemini-audit-*.md
# file in the same commit (or commit batch).  See docs/GEMINI_REQUIRED.md for
# the full approval loop.

# ── Git merge-driver config ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Register the built-in "ours" merge driver so that the docs/episode-27.md
# merge=ours attribute in .gitattributes takes effect on the NEXT merge.
# Running this idempotently on every post-merge ensures the driver is always
# configured, even in a fresh clone or a new Replit workspace.
#
# Effect: when git merges a branch that contains a stale docs/episode-27.md,
# it keeps the receiving branch's (main's) version unconditionally.

# ── Episode content-loss guard ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Blocks this merge outright if any docs/episode-<N>.md file would lose real,
# non-duplicate conversation history relative to the pre-merge state — not
# just a shrinking file (see the two rolling-episode guards below), but any
# removal that isn't a byte-verified duplicate of content still present
# elsewhere in the file. Content-based, not size-based: a version whose total
# size grows while still discarding a real exchange is caught the same way a
# full truncation is.
#
# Unlike the shrinkage guards below, this failure is NOT swallowed — a
# detected loss halts this script here (set -e, top of file) rather than
# landing silently. To authorize an intentional removal, include a
# docs/episode-content-loss-override-<reason>.md file in the same change and
# retry.
#
# See server/services/episode-content-loss-guard.ts for the detection logic
# shared with server/services/source-control-service.ts (the authoritative
# chokepoint for this workspace's own outgoing sync) and
# .github/workflows/cross-tool-promote.yml (the external promotion path).

# Apply only reviewed, committed migration artifacts. `drizzle-kit migrate` is

# ── Episode-27 rolling-episode shrinkage guard ────────────────────────────────
# Episode 27 is currently ROLLING (live, being written in real time).
# Task agents sometimes commit a stale version of docs/episode-27.md that
# predates Luca's most recent edits.  This guard detects shrinkage (the .md
# becoming shorter than the authoritative DB record) and automatically
# restores the DB version to disk before anything else uses the file.
#
# The script exits 0 whether or not a restore was needed, so the overall
# post-merge does NOT fail just because a restore happened.  The restore is
# announced loudly in the log.
#
# When Episode 27 is no longer ROLLING, remove or comment out this block.

# ── Incoming handoff-note surfacing ───────────────────────────────────────────
# docs/alden-agent-handoff.md is git-tracked specifically so a cross-interface
# heads-up arrives the moment it's pulled, not just at next session start —
# a mid-session pull (the common case for an incoming task merge) can be well
# after that session's one-time start-of-session checklist already ran, so a
# file that's only checked there would silently miss it. ORIG_HEAD is git's
# pre-merge ref, set for both a real merge and a fast-forward pull, so this
# fires on the actual arrival of new commits regardless of when in the
# session that happens. Printed last so it's what's on screen when this
# script finishes, not buried under everything above it.
