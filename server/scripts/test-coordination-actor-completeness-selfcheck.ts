// Guards the one actor-completeness registry in the coordination system that
// TypeScript does NOT already enforce exhaustively.
//
// COORDINATION_TOKEN_ENV_BY_ACTOR and COORDINATION_LEGACY_CAPABILITIES_BY_ACTOR
// in server/middleware/coordination-auth.ts are both typed as
// Record<CoordinationActorId, ...> (or Record<Exclude<...>, ...>), so `npm run
// typecheck` already fails hard if either is missing an actor -- no separate
// runtime check is needed for those two.
//
// ALL_COORDINATION_ACTORS in server/services/operations-catalog.ts has no such
// guarantee: it's a plain `readonly CoordinationActorId[]` array literal used
// as the actorScope for "every actor" operations (e.g. production readiness,
// coordination feed). Forgetting an actor there is silent -- the array still
// type-checks, the app still boots, and the omitted actor just quietly loses
// access to those operations. This was caught for real: 'luca-gemini' was
// missing from this array before this self-check and its accompanying fix
// were added (see docs/coordination-new-actor-onboarding.md).
//
// This script does NOT import operations-catalog.ts directly -- that module
// eagerly imports semantic-memory-service, pulling in embedding/DB machinery
// this check has no business depending on. It statically parses the source
// text instead, the same convention used by the validation-suite CI-parity
// guard elsewhere in this repo.
