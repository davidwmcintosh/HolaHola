/**
 * detect-episode-dialogue-loss.ts
 *
 * Detects disappearing episode dialogue automatically instead of relying on
 * manual line-by-line git-history audits.
 *
 * Background: the Sep 21 2026 episode-34 incident (commit 8917df2) deleted a
 * real David/Luca closing exchange ("Good session. Enjoy the rest of your
 * day." and the surrounding Goodhart's-law exchange) while APPENDING
 * unrelated new content in the SAME commit — the file's total byte size
 * actually GREW (297985 → 300823 bytes) even though real dialogue vanished.
 * It sat undetected for ~30 hours because every existing safety net
 * (restore-rolling-episodes-from-db.ts --check-shrinkage, plain size/length
 * comparisons) only fires on NET shrinkage. This tool instead diffs actual
 * paragraph-level CONTENT between two states of a file, regardless of
 * whether the total size grew or shrank.
 *
 * Four independent comparison sources:
 *   1. git history — the current on-disk content vs. the commit(s) that most
 *      recently touched the file. Default mode only evaluates transitions
 *      whose NEWER commit lands within RECENCY_WINDOW_HOURS (72h) of "now" —
 *      this is what makes the check same-day-forward-looking instead of
 *      permanently re-flagging old, already-settled editorial history on
 *      every run (see RECENCY_WINDOW_HOURS below for a real example this
 *      guards against). --full-history walks every consecutive commit pair
 *      in the file's whole history, ignoring recency, for a deliberate
 *      one-time/periodic audit. A transition whose newer side is a deletion
 *      (the file stopped existing at that commit) is NOT skipped — it is
 *      treated as a total loss of everything that existed on the older side.
 *      This is the BLOCKING/PRIMARY signal: it does not depend on any other
 *      system being uncorrupted, and it is what fails the run (exit 2).
 *   2. target-currently-missing — an ALWAYS-ON check (never recency-gated)
 *      that asks "does this target's file exist right now, on disk?" A
 *      target is discovered because it is DB-tagged rolling/rolling-
 *      protected or has any git history at all — either way it is expected
 *      to have a live, current .md. If it does not, that is the single most
 *      severe disappearance case this tool exists to catch (the ENTIRE
 *      episode's dialogue, not just a paragraph within it). This must never
 *      depend on the recency window: recency-gating exists to stop
 *      re-litigating old, ambiguous editorial rewrites, not to give a
 *      permanently-deleted active file a free pass just because nothing
 *      "recent" touched it. Also BLOCKING.
 *   3. working tree vs HEAD — catches a loss that has not been committed
 *      yet. Always checked (not recency-gated: "different from HEAD right
 *      now" is inherently current). Also BLOCKING.
 *   4. conversation_memories DB row (the episode's own whole-content column,
 *      the same row synced by server/scripts/sync-episode-34.ts and friends)
 *      vs the current .md — INFORMATIONAL ONLY, never fails the run on its
 *      own. Caveat: in the real incident, the bad .md was synced INTO this
 *      DB row before the fix, so DB and .md can be corrupted from the same
 *      source and this check alone would show no diff; it also has no
 *      commit-level granularity to tell you which change caused a
 *      difference. It supplements signal #1 as a corroborating data point;
 *      it does not replace it and does not block by itself.
 *
 * Comparison unit: paragraphs (blocks separated by one or more blank lines,
 * ALSO split before any markdown heading line even without a preceding
 * blank line — found necessary against a real "Git commit prior to merge"
 * auto-snapshot commit where a doubled/concatenated file had a paragraph's
 * closing sentence glued directly onto a `# Episode NN — ...` header at the
 * seam between the two copies; without the heading split, that oversized
 * glued unit could never match as a contiguous substring elsewhere even
 * though the paragraph's real text was fully intact). Within each block,
 * lines that are ENTIRELY an HTML comment (e.g.
 * `<!-- inner-life:felt:<timestamp>:<hash> -->`) are stripped before
 * comparison — these carry volatile per-write metadata, and episode-34.md is
 * known to contain legitimate near-duplicate inner-life blocks that differ
 * only in that metadata. This stripping is applied IDENTICALLY to both sides
 * of every comparison (the old block being searched for, and the full new/
 * tip text being searched within) — a metadata comment inserted into an
 * otherwise-unchanged paragraph must never by itself create a false "lost"
 * report by breaking substring contiguity on only one side.
 *
 * A block is reported LOST when its normalized text does not appear ANYWHERE
 * (as a substring) in the normalized full text of the newer version. This is
 * robust to reordering and to blank-line/reflow differences that would
 * confuse a naive line-by-line diff.
 *
 * "Safe revert" guard: if the newer version's full normalized content is
 * byte-identical to some STRICTLY EARLIER commit in the same file's own git
 * history, the transition is a deliberate revert to a known-good state, not
 * silent corruption — losses are not reported for that transition.
 *
 * "Still missing at tip" guard: a block lost in one commit-pair transition
 * but present again in a LATER commit within the same checked window (i.e.
 * a same-day self-heal) does not fail the run — the task this tool exists
 * for asks whether content is absent NOW, and self-healed history is not
 * absent now. It is still logged (non-blocking) so the event stays visible.
 * A CI run at the time of the original loss commit would still have failed,
 * since nothing later existed yet to recover it.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — clean (no loss detected)
 *   1 — fatal error (git unavailable, no target files found, fixture missing)
 *   2 — loss detected
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx server/scripts/detect-episode-dialogue-loss.ts
 *   npx tsx server/scripts/detect-episode-dialogue-loss.ts --full-history
 *   npx tsx server/scripts/detect-episode-dialogue-loss.ts --self-check
