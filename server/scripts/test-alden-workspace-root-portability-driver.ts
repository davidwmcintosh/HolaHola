 * through alden-functions.ts's shared safePath()/WORKSPACE_ROOT plumbing) and
 * prints the results as RESULTS:<json> for the parent to assert on. The
 * parent runs this driver against both the real (fixed) alden-functions.ts
 * and, in --self-check mode only, a temporarily mutated copy that
 * reintroduces the historical hardcoded '/home/runner/workspace' literal --
 * so it must never assume anything about which environment it is running in
 * beyond what HOLAHOLA_WORKSPACE_ROOT and cwd say.

 * must follow the env var, not cwd, which is exactly the property under
 * test. It only issues read-only Alden tool calls (list_directory,
 * read_file), so there is no destructive risk in running it directly, but it
 * still refuses to run without an explicit root: the whole point of this
 * driver is to prove where Alden's tools resolve paths, and silently
 * defaulting to REPL_HOME or cwd would produce a result that looks like a
 * pass or fail for the wrong reason.
