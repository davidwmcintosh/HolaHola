/**
 * CI guard: server/scripts/*.ts must never write to a real path inside a
 * tracked source directory (client/src/, server/, shared/) unless the write
 * is provably sandboxed (routed through mkdtempSync/os.tmpdir()/a
 * create*Sandbox() helper) or covered by an explicit ALLOWLIST entry below.
 *
 * Rationale (Task #1522): several existing self-check scripts prove a
 * regression guard catches a real break by flipping a line in a real, shared
 * source file, running the test, and flipping it back. That corrupts the
 * file mid-mutation for ANY other process reading it concurrently -- another
 * test run, the dev server, an editor's type-checker -- even though the
 * script restores the original bytes afterward. See
 * server/scripts/filter-url-mutation-fixture.ts for the reference-safe
 * alternative: copy the minimal files a test needs into a private
 * mkdtempSync() directory and mutate only the copy. Nothing else can ever
 * observe that mutation.
 *
 * This scanner does not fix the pre-existing offenders (that is a separate,
 * larger change tracked as a follow-up). It exists so a NEW instance of the
 * pattern is caught automatically instead of relying on manual review.
 *
 * ── How it works ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * For every server/scripts/*.ts file, the TypeScript compiler API parses a
 * real AST (not a regex/text scan) and finds every call site of a "writes a
 * whole file" function -- both the Sync and callback/promise forms
 * (writeFileSync/writeFile, appendFileSync/appendFile, outputFileSync/
 * outputFile, copyFileSync/copyFile, renameSync/rename). For the rename/
 * copyFile family the DESTINATION is argument index 1, not 0 -- argument 0
 * is only ever read, never written.
 *
 * The destination argument is then resolved to an absolute path using a
 * small, deliberately single-file expression evaluator that understands:
 *   - string literals, __dirname / import.meta.dirname, process.cwd()
 *   - fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) / __filename
 *   - path.resolve(...) / path.join(...) (and the bare resolve/join forms),
 *     where EVERY argument must resolve concretely (or to a proven sandbox)
 *   - a local `const`/`let`/`var NAME = <expr>` declaration, resolved
 *     LEXICAL-SCOPE-AWARE (walking up the reference's real enclosing
 *     scopes, innermost first) rather than a whole-file "first declaration
 *     with this name anywhere" guess -- a shadowing inner declaration is
 *     never masked by an unrelated, same-named outer one -- one level of
 *     indirection at a time (cycle-guarded)
 *   - member access on a sandbox-derived identifier (e.g. sandbox.logicFile)
 *   - mkdtempSync(...)/mkdtemp(...)/tmpdir() calls, and calls to a helper
 *     listed in TRUSTED_SANDBOX_FACTORIES -- each is trusted only when it
 *     resolves, through this file's own import declarations, to the real
 *     node:fs/node:os module (or the exact allowlisted helper module); a
 *     same-file function merely NAMED like one of these (e.g. a local
 *     `function createFakeSandbox()`) is never trusted just because of
 *     its name
 *   - a write-function callee (writeFileSync, etc.) is resolved through a
 *     named-import alias first, so `import { writeFileSync as put } from
 *     'node:fs'; put(...)` is still detected as a writeFileSync call
 *
 * ── Fail-closed default (Task #1522 review requirement) ──────────────────
 * A resolved path is a VIOLATION if it falls inside client/src/, server/, or
 * shared/ and is not covered by a `kind: 'target'` ALLOWLIST entry.
 *
 * Anything the evaluator CANNOT resolve to a concrete path or a proven
 * sandbox -- a bare function parameter, a cross-file import, a template
 * literal, a conditional expression, string concatenation, an object
 * returned from another function, an env-var override, an OS-specific
 * branch, etc. -- is ALSO a violation unless covered by a `kind:
 * 'unresolved'` ALLOWLIST entry. Unresolvable is never silently treated as
 * safe: this scanner does not know whether an unresolvable target is inside
 * a tracked directory, and a script author must not be able to bypass the
 * guard just by making the destination expression hard to analyze
 * statically (a template literal, a ternary, string concatenation, a
 * cross-file helper, `new URL(...)`, ... -- see the negative self-checks
 * below, which prove each of these forms is still caught).
 *
 * Every `kind: 'unresolved'` entry below was individually verified BY
 * READING THE SOURCE, not guessed -- each one traces to a real sandbox
 * (mkdtempSync/tmpdir/create*Sandbox) or a real non-tracked path (a
 * `.local/`-relative workspace file, an operator-supplied CLI/env override,
 * a Windows-only path, etc.) that this deliberately simple, single-file
 * evaluator cannot prove on its own (usually because doing so needs
 * cross-file resolution, tracing a value through another function's return
 * statement, or combining conditional branches).
 *
 * ── Adding a new script that writes into a tracked directory ────────────
 *   - Prefer routing the write through a temp/sandbox path (mkdtempSync,
 *     os.tmpdir(), or a create*Sandbox() helper). No allowlist entry needed,
 *     and no other process can ever observe the write.
 *   - If a write must legitimately target a tracked path, or the target
 *     expression is simply too dynamic for this evaluator to resolve, add an
 *     explicit ALLOWLIST entry below with a reason. This is a conscious
 *     opt-in, not a silent pass -- and the "stale ALLOWLIST entry" test below
 *     will fail if the entry stops matching a real call site (e.g. because
 *     the write was removed or the expression text changed).
 *
 * Run with:
 *   npx tsx --test server/scripts/scan-source-mutation-writes.test.ts
