 * Regression check: an old Guardian lookup must never make Daniela answer an

 *
 * Reproduces the live diagnostic sequence:
 *   1. Earlier guitar assertion starts an Archive lookup.
 *   2. David asks about the counting game before that lookup resolves.
 *   3. The guitar result is stale and must be discarded.
 *   4. The current counting lookup remains the only grounding context.
