/**
 * episode-content-loss-guard.ts
 *
 * Core, git-runner-agnostic logic that detects when a change to a
 * `docs/episode-<N>.md` file would silently remove real conversation history.
 *
 * Background (task #1529): a commit that bundles unrelated work with a stale
 * read of an episode file can blindly overwrite it, dropping real dialogue
 * that the live chat-capture pipeline appended in the meantime. This has
 * happened twice (confirmed by git-blob forensics):
 *   - 2026-08-31: an unrelated "Update agent memory logs" commit wiped
 *     episode-27.md to 0 bytes and truncated episode-28.md by ~237KB.
 *   - 2026-09-21: an unrelated auth-work commit deleted a real closing
 *     exchange from episode-34.md and replaced it with different content —
 *     the file's *total size grew*, so a shrinkage/size-only check (see
 *     restore-episode-27-from-db.ts / restore-episode-28-from-db.ts) would
 *     not have caught it.
 *
 * Known false-positive class (fixed 2026-09-22, this guard's first day in
 * production): docs/episode-<N>.md paths are also used as throwaway CI test
 * fixtures by scripts written before this guard existed (e.g.
 * server/scripts/test-chat-episode-hook-e2e.ts writes docs/episode-9993.md
 * as setup and unlinks it as teardown). Each task agent runs in its own
 * isolated environment, so nothing forces a commit to wait for another
 * repl's background test to finish cleaning up — a fixture file can be
 * mid-lifecycle (present on disk) at the exact moment an unrelated commit's
 * `git add -A` sweeps it in. A later, unrelated commit made without that
 * stray file then looks, to a path-and-content-only check, exactly like
 * real content loss. See RESERVED_FIXTURE_EPISODE_MIN below for the fix.
 *
 * Detection is content-based, not size-based: every non-trivial line present
 * in the "old" version of a protected episode file must still be present
 * somewhere in the "new" version, unless an explicit override doc is present
 * in the same change. A line that was removed from one place but still
 * exists verbatim elsewhere in the new file (a legitimate dedup) is *not* a
 * violation — plain set-membership already implements that exception
 * correctly, with no separate multiset/counting logic required.
 *
 * This module never mutates git state — it only reads via an injected
 * `GitRunner`, so it can run from a CLI (server/scripts/check-episode-
 * content-loss.ts), be embedded in server/services/source-control-service.ts
 * (the sole authority for git mutations in this repo — see
 * server/scripts/test-source-control-mutation-boundary.ts), or run against a
 * hermetic temp repo in a self-check.
