 * Fires whenever Luca posts a message to the HolaHola Team Room.
 * If a rolling episode is currently active (a conversation_memories row tagged
 * "rolling" in the "HolaHola Episodes" arc), the message is appended to the
 * episode .md via the .local/.episode_append trigger file.
 *
 * Attribution label: LUCA [HolaHola]:  (per the episode source attribution taxonomy)
 *
 * Collision guard: writes are serialised through an in-process promise queue
 * so two rapid Team Room posts cannot race and lose each other's content.
 * Each write also reads the existing trigger file before writing, so any
 * content the autosave watcher has not yet drained is merged rather than
 * overwritten.
