/**
 * Agent Session Autosave
 *
 * Watches files for changes and saves to conversation_memories automatically:
 *
 * 1. .local/.commit_message — updated at end of every build task (before mark_task_complete).
 *    Saves as entry_type='build'. Captures what code was built.
 *    Also triggers a transcript chunk save (see #3).
 *
 * 2. .local/.session_insights — written by the Agent mid-conversation when something
 *    important surfaces that shouldn't wait until end-of-session. Accepts JSON or plain text.
 *    Saves as entry_type='emergence'. Captures wisdom, principles, corrections.
 *
 * 3. Chat-capture drain — automatic once turns are in .local/.chat_capture.
 *    Replit stopped writing JSONL transcript files after Jul 27 2026, so JSONL-based
 *    capture is no longer possible. The replacement path uses an append-only
 *    .local/.chat_capture file. Any code (or script) that calls appendChatCaptureTurn()
 *    places a turn in the file; the autosave worker then drains it to conversation_memories
 *    within milliseconds (fs.watch) or at most 20 seconds (poll) — fully automatic from
 *    that point on.
 *
 *    Turns can be written via:
 *      - code:   appendChatCaptureTurn(speaker, text) from transcript-parser.ts
 *      - script: npx tsx server/scripts/capture-exchange.ts --david "..." --luca "..."
 *      - file:   echo '{"david":"...","luca":"..."}' > .local/.luca_auto_capture
 *
 *    The drain step (file → DB) is fully automatic. The entry step is semi-manual
 *    only because Replit no longer exposes a machine-readable transcript source.
 *
 *    Cursor stored in .local/.chat_capture_cursor.json — only new turns are saved each time.
 *
 * Format for .session_insights:
 *   JSON: { "title": "...", "summary": "...", "content": "...", "tags": ["..."] }
 *   Plain text: first line = title, rest = content (summary auto-derived from first 3 lines)
 *
 * All watchers poll every 60 seconds.

  // Seed inner-life watcher mtimes so first poll doesn't re-fire on existing files.
  //
  // Bug fix (Task #1023): if a trigger file was written BEFORE the restart (e.g.
  // Luca wrote .luca_question mid-session, then the server restarted), the old
  // code seeded the mtime to the file's real mtime.  On the first poll the guard
  // saw `mtime > lastMtime` → false → skipped entirely, so the note was lost.
  //
  // Fix: if the file has non-zero content we seed the mtime to 1 (a non-zero
  // sentinel below any real mtime).  On the next poll:
  //   mtime > 1          → true  → enters the processing block
  //   prev = 1 ≠ 0       → the "skip initial read on startup" guard does NOT fire
  //   → content is processed normally.
  // If the file is empty there is nothing to process — seed the real mtime so the
  // guard correctly skips the empty file.
  // Cross-process coordination (Task #1235): the capture-watchdog may be
  // mid-drain right now (it decides ownership by the stale heartbeat and only
  // writes its processed-sha state AFTER its DB work). The seed NEVER runs
  // without owning the shared inner-life lock — see seedInnerLifeTriggerState.
  // Runs async: inner-life polls are gated on innerLifeSeedComplete, so no
  // trigger processing can happen before seeding has safely completed.

  // from a prior session, clear it before arming the watcher.  Seeding the mtime alone
  // is not enough — the content-hash approach requires us to know the prior hash, which
  // we don't have across restarts.  Clearing is safe because the prior session's watcher
