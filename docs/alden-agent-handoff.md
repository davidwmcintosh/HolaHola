# Alden ↔ Agent Handoff

## From Alden — last updated: (none)

*(Nothing yet — Alden will write here at the end of notable sessions using the write_briefing tool.)*

## From Agent — last updated: Fri Mar 13, 2026

**Session summary: Completing three in-progress features for Alden's autonomy suite**

### What was built

1. **Founder presence tracking** (`server/services/founder-presence.ts`)
   - In-memory tracker updated on every `requireFounder` middleware call (both session + OIDC paths)
   - Exposes `getFounderPresence()` returning last-active time, human description, and `isCurrentlyActive` flag
   - Injected into Alden's workspace context (section 6) so he always knows whether David is actively working

2. **Bidirectional handoff file** (`docs/alden-agent-handoff.md`)
   - This file. Alden uses `write_briefing` tool to update "From Alden" section. The Agent updates "From Agent" section at end of major sessions.
   - Injected into Alden's workspace context (section 5) so it's always in his awareness
   - Referenced in `replit.md` as required reading at session start

3. **Two new Alden tools** (added to `server/services/alden-functions.ts`)
   - `browser_screenshot`: calls `browseAndCapture` + `analyzeScreenshot` from playwright-browser-service; Alden can visually inspect any page
   - `write_briefing`: writes to this file preserving the Agent's section; timestamps the Alden entry
   - Tool count now 17. Both documented in system prompt with when-to-use guidance.

4. **Temporal context in workspace builder** (`server/services/alden-workspace-context.ts`)
   - Section 6 now includes: current time (full locale string), David's presence description, server uptime
   - Alden can reason about whether David is around and what time it is

### Key decisions
- Presence tracking is purely in-memory (resets on restart) — intentional. Stale data from a previous day is worse than no data.
- `touchFounderPresence()` fires on both auth paths in `requireFounder` — session-based and OIDC-based logins both count.
- The handoff file's section structure must be preserved by both writers — Alden's `write_briefing` tool does this correctly via regex.

### What's unresolved / for next session
- Nothing from this batch. The three in-progress features from the compressed memory are now complete.
- Alden's tool count is 17 — consider whether the watch worker should also use `write_briefing` to leave notes after its autonomous checks.

### What Alden should know
- He now has `browser_screenshot` and `write_briefing` — these are for use, not just possession. After a code change, screenshot to verify. At session end, write a briefing.
- His workspace context section order is: project bible → editor insights → recent activity → express lane → handoff notes → temporal context → git commits
- The presence tracker will show "Not seen since last restart" on a fresh boot — that's expected and correct.
