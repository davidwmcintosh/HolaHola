### Session: December 11, 2025 - Tri-Lane Hive Architecture

**Overview**: Expanded from single-agent (Daniela) to multi-agent architecture with three specialized AI agents that collaborate through shared neural network infrastructure.

#### Tri-Lane Hive Model

| Agent | Role | Domain | Primary Tables |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| **Daniela** | AI Tutor & Partner | Pedagogy, student experience | `daniela_suggestions`, `reflection_triggers` |
| **Editor** | Development Agent | Architecture, tooling, performance | `agent_observations` |
| **Support** | Operations Agent | User friction, troubleshooting, proactive alerts | `support_observations`, `system_alerts` |

#### Schema Changes

1. **`daniela_suggestions`** - Added collaboration metadata:
   - `originRole` - tutor or partner
   - `domainTags[]` - pedagogy, architecture, tooling, student_experience
   - `intentHash` - cross-agent deduplication hash
   - `acknowledgedByEditor` - Editor reviewed if architecture-affecting
   - `acknowledgedAt` - timestamp of acknowledgment

2. **`agent_observations`** - Added collaboration metadata:
   - `originRole` - editor (development agent)
   - `domainTags[]` - architecture, performance, pedagogy, operations
   - `intentHash` - cross-agent deduplication hash
   - `acknowledgedByDaniela` - Daniela reviewed if pedagogy-affecting
   - `acknowledgedBySupport` - Support reviewed if operations-affecting
   - `acknowledgedAt` - timestamp of acknowledgment

3. **NEW: `support_observations`** - Support Agent's neural network:
   - Categories: user_friction, common_question, system_issue, feature_request, success_pattern, documentation_gap, onboarding_insight, billing_pattern, troubleshoot_solution
   - Same sync contract as other observation tables
   - `escalationNeeded` flag for urgent issues
   - `proposedFaqEntry` for auto-generating help content

4. **NEW: `system_alerts`** - Proactive Support communications:
   - Severity: info, notice, warning, outage, resolved
   - Target: all, voice_users, teachers, students, new_users, premium
   - `showInChat` / `showAsBanner` display modes
   - `startsAt` / `expiresAt` timing
   - `relatedIncidentId` / `resolvedByAlertId` for linking warning → resolution

#### Collaboration APIs

- `getCollaborationContext()` - Surfaces approved entries from all three tables with provenance
- `getPendingAcknowledgments(forRole)` - Gets observations awaiting review by specific role
- `syncTriLaneObservations()` - Bulk sync all observation tables to production
- `generateIntentHash()` - Creates deduplication hash for cross-agent matching

#### Proactive Support Features

Support agent can:
- Post system alerts when outages detected
- Announce degraded performance proactively
- Send maintenance notices in advance
- Warn about known bugs before users hit them
- Celebrate new feature releases

#### Files Modified

- `shared/schema.ts` - Added collaboration metadata + new tables
- `server/storage.ts` - Added Support/Alert CRUD + collaboration APIs
- `server/services/neural-network-sync.ts` - Added Tri-Lane sync methods

## Next Steps / Action Items

### Completed This Session
- [x] Created `docs/neural-network-architecture.md` - single-source-of-truth for neural network work
- [x] Archived sessions 9-20o to `docs/archive/`
- [x] Designed Tri-Lane Hive architecture (3 agents)
- [x] Added collaboration metadata to `daniela_suggestions` and `agent_observations`
- [x] Created `support_observations` table with full sync contract
- [x] Created `system_alerts` table for proactive communications
- [x] Implemented cross-agent collaboration APIs
- [x] Added Tri-Lane sync methods to `neural-network-sync.ts`

### Future Enhancements

1. **Syllabus Progress Integration** - Connect SYLLABUS_PROGRESS command to `studentSyllabusTopicCompetencies` table for actual competency tracking

2. **ACTFL Analytics Dashboard** - Command Center view showing Daniela's ACTFL assessments over time

3. **Neural Network Health Check** - Tool to verify all 15 tables are syncing correctly

## How to Use This File

When making changes that need documentation:

1. Add a session entry with date and overview
2. Document the problem, solution, and files modified
3. Note any sync requirements
4. Create action items for follow-up

When consolidating:

1. Move completed sessions to `docs/archive/`
2. Update relevant docs (TECHNICAL-REFERENCE.md, USER-MANUAL.md, etc.)
3. Clear this file
