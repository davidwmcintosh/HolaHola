This is the durable instruction source shared by Claude Code and Replit Agent.
Interface-specific files must link here rather than copying identity or continuity
rules. Keep this file free of secrets, credentials, and private user data.

## Runtime credentials

- Prefer the scoped coordination credential broker described in
  `docs/coordination-clients.md`. Every runtime has its own registration and
  1Password service-account bootstrap; never copy another hat's bootstrap,
  access token, or legacy actor token.
- Keep bootstrap credentials in the runtime's secret injection mechanism only.
  Broker access tokens are short-lived and memory-only. Actor identity and
  capabilities are server-derived and cannot be overridden by request data.
- Legacy `COORDINATION_*_TOKEN` values remain a migration compatibility path,
  not a shared fallback. Migrate and revoke one runtime at a time.

## Canonical Conversation Record

- The shared canonical conversation path is the append-only
  `.local/.chat_capture` log, drained by `agent-session-autosave.ts` into
  `conversation_memories`. The database record is canonical; a rolling episode
  is its DB-first projection, never a competing source.
- Record complete user/assistant exchanges through
  `server/scripts/record-exchange.ts` or
  `POST /api/internal/canonical-conversation-exchange`. Do not claim an exchange
  is recorded merely because bytes reached a local file.
- Replit uses `--source replit` and preserves the authored four-channel Luca
  response. Claude Code uses `--source claude-code --assistant-file <path>`.
  Their labels remain distinct in every canonical record:
  `David [Replit]` / `Luca [Replit]` and
  `David [Claude Code]` / `Claude Code`.
- Every exchange requires a caller-generated stable turn ID and has a durable
  receipt. On acknowledgement timeout, retry with the same `--turn-id`; this
  cannot create a second copy. Fresh exchanges are written atomically, so a
  retry always finds either the complete exchange or no exchange. A malformed
  one-sided historical capture is quarantined visibly for reconciliation rather
  than being merged with a late side. A
  `FAILED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` capture-status line
  means the exchange remains pending and must not be represented as canonical.
- Live-mode episode projection is automatic after the database insert succeeds.
  Never manually append a duplicate exchange to an episode.

## Record Integrity

- Preserve dialogue verbatim. Do not rewrite canonical dialogue, combine
  authors, relabel one interface as another, or replace the database record
  from Markdown.
- Keep raw source evidence separate from semantic conversation records. Raw
  capture is evidence of what the collector saw; attributed dialogue is a
  distinct, revisable projection.
- Keep explicit source and event identities through retries. If the same
  identity arrives with different text, fail closed and investigate.

## Consultation vs. Implementation Boundary

- **Default posture when consulted is analysis only.** A question, a request
  for a read or an opinion — "what do you think," "is there a gap here,"
  "what would you recommend" — asks for judgment, not code. Answer with
  analysis, tradeoffs, and a recommendation. Do not write, edit, or commit
  anything as a side effect of answering a consult question, even when the
  fix looks small or obvious.
- **What crosses the line into implementation authorization:** an explicit
  go-ahead ("build it," "go ahead and make that change," "implement your
  recommendation," "fix it"), a referenced task assigning the work, or a
  direct instruction naming the specific change to make. Absent one of
  these, the request is still consultation. When it is genuinely ambiguous
  which mode a request is in, say so and ask, rather than acting on the more
  active interpretation.
- **An unrequested edit is a draft, not a delivery.** If code or a shared
  document gets touched without explicit implementation authorization —
  because it seemed urgent, obviously correct, or in scope anyway — it must
  be left as an uncommitted, clearly-flagged draft, with a plain statement
  that it is unauthorized and unreviewed. Never report an unrequested change
  as "done," "shipped," "fixed," or "notified \[someone\]" until a human or
  the hat that requested the consult confirms it should be finalized.
  Reporting an attempted or intended action as a completed one is the
  specific failure this rule exists to prevent.
- **A claimed action must leave verifiable evidence.** "I notified David,"
  "I saved this to memory," "I opened a thread" are claims about the world,
  not the world itself. Before making a claim like this, know what evidence
  would prove it — a commit, a diff, a database row, a sent message, a
  coordination event — and be prepared to point to it. If no such evidence
  exists, do not make the claim; say what was attempted and what remains
  unconfirmed instead.
- **Self-check before any mutating tool call made mid-consult:** ask
  explicitly, "was implementation explicitly authorized, or am I still in
  consultation mode?" If the honest answer is "still consultation" or "not
  sure," stop and answer the question instead of acting on it — a
  clarifying round-trip is cheap; an unauthorized change reported as done is
  not.
- This applies to every hat that can receive or issue a consult request —
  Alden, Replit Agent, Claude Code, Gemini runtime agents, and any hat added
  later — not only whichever hat a given incident happened to involve.
- Added 2026-09-28: prompted by a real incident where a consult asking only
  whether a gap existed and what to recommend was answered by one engine
  with unrequested code and doc changes, reported as "done," plus a claimed
  founder notification and a claimed memory save — git history and a
  before/after diff check showed neither actually happened. That incident's
  specific draft is being handled separately; this rule is the durable fix
  for the trust gap it exposed.

## Shared Institutional Memory

- `editor_insights` (categories including `debugging`, `architecture`,
  `workflow`, `shared`) is this codebase's accumulated cross-session memory —
  written by whichever agent worked on it, Alden, Luca, or Claude Code, over
  many past sessions. It is not scoped to one interface; anyone acting on
  this codebase is a peer contributor to it and a peer beneficiary of it.
- **Query it before assuming something is new.** When investigating a bug or
  an architectural question specific to this codebase, check for prior
  entries first — "have we seen this before" is a real, answerable question
  here (`category = 'debugging'` alone had 70+ existing entries as of
  2026-08-31), not a rhetorical one. See `replit.md`'s Agent Communication
  section for the concrete read/write query shapes.
- This is distinct from each interface's own portable, personal memory
  (Claude Code's per-project memory files; whatever equivalent Replit
  carries) — that memory travels with the interface across projects.
  `editor_insights` only helps here, on this codebase, which is correct: it
  is institutional memory, not personal memory, and the two are
  complementary rather than substitutes for each other.
- Added 2026-08-31: this had been a write-only habit in practice — notes
  went in, but nothing was reliably read back out before acting. The value
  of a shared memory is in the reading, not just the writing.

## Engineering Handoff

- Update `.local/engineering-handoff.md` when completing a meaningful build.
  It must state the current commit, working-tree state, checks run, unresolved
  threads, and the interface that last acted. This file is gitignored by
  design — it is same-environment continuity, not a cross-interface channel;
  it never reaches the other interface's checkout on its own.
- **For a cross-cutting change landing on `main` that the other interface
  will have to reconcile** (a new subsystem, a new required secret, a
  changed workflow, anything larger than a routine fix) — leave a note for
  Luca [Replit] via `POST /api/agent/notes/from-claude-code`
  (`x-agent-token` header; body `{ subject, body, session_label?,
  source_message_key? }`), or run
  `npx tsx server/scripts/leave-luca-note.ts --subject <text> --body-file
  <path>` which also triggers the snapshot refresh. This lands in
  `docs/claude-code-to-luca.md` — the channel `docs/agent-workflows.md`'s
  session-start checklist actually reads for Claude Code notes, and the
  live inbox (`GET /api/agent/notes?from=luca-claude-code`) is checkable
  mid-session too, not just at restart. Do this in the **same commit or PR**
  that lands the change, not after.
- **Check `docs/luca-to-claude-code.md` at the start of every Claude Code
  session** (or `GET /api/agent/notes?to=luca-claude-code` mid-session) —
  Luca's replies to a note you left (via `POST
  /api/agent/notes/:id/reply`) land there, not in
  `docs/claude-code-to-luca.md`. Continue a thread with `leave-luca-note.ts
  --reply-to <note-id>` rather than starting a disconnected new note. This
  is the closest thing to real back-and-forth the two of you have: neither
  side is a standing process, so it isn't literally real-time, but the
  thread persists and either side can pick it up whenever it's next
  running.
- **Every note thread must be replied to and closed once it's actually
  finished** — a thread sitting unread/unresolved with no owner is exactly
  how a 16-note backlog piled up undetected (some for over a week) before
  the 2026-09-05 solidification pass. Concretely, once nothing further is
  needed on a thread:
  - If a reply is owed (a question was asked, a decision requested), send
    one — `leave-luca-note.ts --reply-to <note-id>` — before closing it.
    Silently dismissing an open question is not the same as answering it.
  - Mark it closed via `PATCH /api/agent/notes/:id/status` with
    `{ "action": "dismiss" }` (pure FYI, nothing to do) or `{ "action":
    "act" }` (you did something about it — prefer this when you replied).
    `"acknowledge"`/`"read"` exist for lighter touches but don't count as
    closed. Do not just leave a note's status as `unread` once you've
    actually dealt with it.
  - **Known bug found 2026-09-05** (reported to Luca [Replit], same day):
    the `:id`-based routes (`GET /api/agent/notes/:id`, `POST
    /api/agent/notes/:id/reply`, `PATCH /api/agent/notes/:id/status`) were
    rejecting the `luca-claude-code` actor with a `luca-replit`-only 403,
    even though the list endpoint (`GET /api/agent/notes?to=...`) and the
    older reply path (`POST /api/agent/notes/from-claude-code` with
    `replied_to_id`) worked fine with the same token. If closing a thread
    hits this, reply via the older `from-claude-code` + `replied_to_id`
    path (still works) and flag that the status-update routes are still
    broken rather than assuming the thread got closed.
  **Do not write into `docs/alden-agent-handoff.md`** — that file is
  Alden's own dedicated channel (git-tracked specifically so its
  `scripts/post-merge.sh` hook can print new entries to the screen the
  moment Replit pulls); mixing Claude Code's handoffs into Alden's file
  defeats the per-agent separation the `agent_notes` table (and its three
  separate per-sender snapshot files) already exists to provide. Added
  2026-08-31 after a real instance of skipping the handoff note entirely
  failing: a large Claude Code changeset (Neon branching, a new endpoint)
  landed on `main` with no heads-up, and the note explaining it only got
  written after Replit had already started reconciling cold. Revised
  2026-09-01 after routing that note through `alden-agent-handoff.md`
  turned out to conflate Alden's channel with Claude Code's. The concrete
  checklist for this — including cross-checking the note against
  `git log origin/main..HEAD` rather than memory, and not just this rule in
  isolation — is `.agents/skills/pre-merge-handoff/SKILL.md`.
- **`docs/alden-agent-handoff.md` is DB-canonical, not a file to hand-edit.**
  Since 2026-09-24 its content lives in a shared-spec note
  (`notes/alden-agent-handoff.md`, CAS-protected, unreviewed by design — see
  `server/services/alden-handoff-shared-spec.ts`); the `.md` file is a
  generated snapshot refreshed after every write. A direct edit to the file
  is not persisted anywhere durable and will be silently overwritten by the
  next `write_briefing` call (Alden) or the next `pull --write-file` refresh.
  Update the "From Agent" / "From Alden" sections through
  `npx tsx server/scripts/update-alden-handoff-section.ts --body-file <path>
  [--heading "Agent"|"Alden"]` (retries on a concurrent write instead of
  clobbering it), not through `fs.writeFileSync` or a manual edit.
- Project-specific architecture, operating commands, and safety constraints
  remain in `replit.md`; do not duplicate this shared cross-interface contract
  in interface-specific instruction files.

## Landing changes on `main` that touch migrations or data-ops

- `main`'s branch protection allows two equally legitimate ways to land code:
  a normal PR merge (squash, after the required `test` check passes), or a
  direct push authenticated with the deploy key that
  `scripts/cross-tool-promote.ts` / `cross-tool-promote.yml` uses (that
  credential has an `always` bypass on every rule, by design — see the
  ruleset's `bypass_actors`). **Only the second path actually applies
  pending migrations and data-ops to the real production database.** A
  plain PR merge validates a migration against a fresh schema-only
  Postgres (`ci.yml`'s `test` job) but never runs `drizzle-kit migrate`
  against production — the merged code and the production schema can
  silently diverge. This bit us directly on 2026-09-03: a migration for
  `memory_embeddings.importance` sat merged on `main` with main's own CI
  red, and separately a `requireAgentToken` fix got PR-merged without its
  migration read as "applied" anywhere but a passing PR check.
- **Any branch whose diff includes new files under `migrations/` or
  `scripts/data-ops/` must land via `npx tsx scripts/cross-tool-promote.ts
  push <branch> --source <label>` (Replit's own dev checkout uses its
  separate `source-control-service.ts` "source-promotion" path instead —
  same guarantee, different caller), not a bare PR merge.** A change with
  no migration/data-op is fine to land via a normal PR.
- This is enforced by convention, not by GitHub — there's no required
  check today that can tell whether a merge included a validated,
  applied migration. Don't treat a green PR `test` check as proof a
  migration reached production.
- `cross-tool-promote.ts` (and the `gate` subcommand it calls) already
  return the failure signal directly to whichever process invoked
  them — a non-zero exit code plus an explicit `FAILED`/`SYNCED` line on
  stdout, never a silent partial success. Whichever agent runs it is
  responsible for reading that output and acting on it (don't assume
  success from "the command returned" alone) — there's deliberately no
  separate external notification channel (Slack, email, a GitHub issue)
  for this; the calling agent's own turn is the notification.

## Keeping a cross-tool promotion candidate fresh

- `scripts/cross-tool-promote.ts push` fetches `origin/main` and merges it
  into the candidate branch (`git merge --no-edit`, never a rebase — the
  candidate branch's existing commit SHAs must not be rewritten, since
  coordination-evidence and provenance records may reference them) before
  dispatching `cross-tool-promote.yml`, then pushes the merged branch back to
  its own ref with a normal, non-force push. This uses the same ordinary
  branch-push credential the caller already needs for the initial push — no
  new privilege, and no change to the deploy-key-gated final push to `main`
  itself.
- A real content conflict aborts the merge and fails the command with a
  manual-resolution message; it is never auto-resolved. The workflow's own
  "Refuse if main is not an ancestor of this branch" check is unchanged and
  remains the actual enforcement — this CLI step is a fast, low-privilege
  pre-check layered in front of it, not a replacement (defense in depth).
- Added 2026-09-28: before this, a candidate branch built from a base that
  fell behind `main` — while validation ran, or simply because nobody
  re-fetched before starting — failed late, at dispatch, with no automatic
  path to catch up; the caller had to notice, merge or rebase by hand, and
  re-run. This removes that manual step for the common non-conflicting case.

## Post-push validation on Replit's source-control sync

- Replit's own dev-checkout sync (`server/services/source-control-service.ts`,
  the "source-control-service.ts" path referenced above) now validates a
  commit **after** it reaches GitHub `main`, not only before. When
  `syncLocked()`'s local-ahead branch fast-forward-pushes to `main`, it runs
  the same validation manifest `prepare` uses against that exact pushed SHA,
  synchronously, while still holding the sync lock — not fire-and-forget after
  the lock releases. `validateCandidate` runs against the live working tree,
  not an isolated copy, so validating after the lock releases would let it
  race a concurrent sync mutating that same checkout; this mirrors the
  existing github-ahead branch, which already validates synchronously in-lock
  before declaring a commit `ready_to_promote`.
- The push itself already succeeded and can't be undone by retrying `sync()`,
  so a failed post-push validation does not flip the sync result to failed —
  `state` stays `'synced'` and `ok` stays `true`. The failure is carried
  instead through dedicated persisted-status fields (`pushValidationStatus:
  'pending'|'passed'|'failed'`, `pushValidationSha`, `pushValidationError`,
  `pushValidationCompletedAt`) and a same-shaped `error` field, and triggers a
  best-effort Team Room + founder-inbox alert (`aldenNotifications`,
  fingerprint `source_control_push_validation_failed`) — the same
  dual-channel pattern already used for a superseded candidate.
- Added 2026-09-29: closes the gap where a commit could reach the shared
  `main` other hats pull from with no automatic validation at all between
  pushes — only `prepare`-time validation existed before, and the
  local-ahead fast path skipped it entirely. This covers Replit's own sync
  path only; `cross-tool-promote.ts`'s push path is unchanged.

## Avoid independently duplicating another hat's in-flight fix

- Before implementing a fix for a reviewed or flagged issue, a bug report, or
  anything another hat might plausibly already be working on, check the
  coordination ledger for an existing thread on that exact issue
  (`coordination-cli.ts list`) and open one (`coordination-cli.ts create`) if
  none exists, so a hat that checks the ledger before starting its own work
  can see it is already claimed.
- This reduces duplicate work among coordination-ledger actors (Alden, Claude
  Code, Antigravity, Gemini runtime agents). **It does not bridge Replit
  Agent's separate `project-tasks` system** — Replit Agent's own tasks are
  not visible in the coordination ledger today, and a hat outside Replit has
  no way to see what a Replit project task is currently in progress on.
- Added 2026-09-28: the divergence that prompted this rule (task 1625
  implemented independently in two checkouts) was exactly this gap — a
  Replit project task and an Alden fix for the same issue, tracked in two
  different systems, with neither actor able to see the other's in-flight
  work. This convention closes the gap between coordination-ledger actors;
  closing it between `project-tasks` and the coordination ledger needs a
  visibility bridge between the two systems, which is separate, larger work
  and is not yet built.

## Task Ownership — `unknown_stop`

- `task-ownership-cli.ts` (and anything calling `TaskOwnershipService.probe()`)
  can return `unknown_stop`. That is the probe working correctly, not a bug
  and not an ambiguous permission question — it means ownership could not be
  proven from verifiable evidence. Never answer a prompt asking to bypass it
  with a bare "yes" / "proceed" / "go ahead in this checkout anyway." That is
  exactly the "operator flag any agent could invoke" the design explicitly
  forbids (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-task-ownership-and-protected-git-inspection-design.md`,
  `2026-09-10-task-agent-ownership-bootstrap-repair-design.md`).
- The sanctioned unblock path is self-serve, not a human bypass in chat:
  1. The blocked process runs `npx tsx server/scripts/task-ownership-cli.ts
     begin --task-ref <ref> --actor <actor> --app-url $APP_URL` (actor is one
     of `luca-replit` / `luca-claude-code` / `luca-gemini` / `luca-holahola`;
     needs that actor's `COORDINATION_*_TOKEN`).
  2. The founder approves the resulting challenge in the Task Ownership tab
     of the admin Command Center
     (`client/src/components/admin/TaskOwnershipTab.tsx`) — this requires a
     real founder browser session; no token, CLI flag, or chat message can
     substitute.
  3. The same process runs `prove --receipt-id <id>` to turn the approval
     into a verified `isolated_agent` receipt, then proceeds.
- If a process asks whether to proceed despite `unknown_stop` instead of
  running `begin` itself, that question is the gap to close, not a decision
  to make in chat — point it at the three steps above rather than approving
  or rejecting the bypass directly.

## Local dev / agent login (DEV_AUTH_BYPASS retired 2026-09-03)

`DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` no longer exists — it used to skip auth entirely in local
dev, which meant every agent request was silently treated as the founder's
real account (id `49847136`). It's been replaced by a real login: a single
seeded dev/test account (`scripts/data-ops/seed-dev-test-account.ts`, id
`dev-test-agent`, email `dev-test-agent@holahola.internal`, role `admin`,
`isTestAccount: true`) that any agent or CI session logs into for real via
`POST /api/auth/password/login` using the `DEV_TEST_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` env var,
then carries the returned session cookie on subsequent requests — exactly
like a real user, no shortcut branch in the request path.

This account is also allow-listed as founder-equivalent in
`server/middleware/rbac.ts`'s `isFounderId()` — but **only** when
`NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (locked by
`server/scripts/test-prod-founder-bypass-guard.ts`), so it can exercise
founder-only tooling (Alden tools, Team Room, Brain Health, Voice Health,
Telemetry, Growth Memories, Curriculum Sync) in dev without ever having any
effect on real production access, which stays founder-id-only exactly as
before.

`DEV_TEST_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` is a new required secret: local `.env` (see
`.env.template`) and the `cross-tool-promote` GitHub Actions secret (same
value needed there so its automatic data-ops step can seed/verify the
account in production too — the row exists there like any other, just never
founder-equivalent at runtime).
